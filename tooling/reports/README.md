# Build-Time Reports

This directory contains **auto-generated** build and bundle analysis reports.

## Purpose
- Store JSON reports from tooling scripts (e.g., `bundle-check.mjs`)
- Provide local debugging and analysis data
- **Not committed to git** (see `.gitignore`)

## Files
- `bundle-report.json` - Bundle size analysis (auto-generated by `npm run guard:bundle`)

## Notes
- All `*.json` files in this directory are gitignored
- Reports are regenerated on each build/guard run
- Safe to delete - will be recreated automatically
